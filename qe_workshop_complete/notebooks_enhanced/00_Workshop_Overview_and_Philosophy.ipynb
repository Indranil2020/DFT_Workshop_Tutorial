    "**Every DFT calculation is only as meaningful as the input structure and parameters.**\n",
    "\n",
    "This seems obvious, yet it is violated constantly in computational materials science. The temptation to \"just run a calculation\" and interpret whatever numbers emerge is strong, especially with modern computing power making calculations fast and accessible.\n",

    "### 1.2 Common Mistakes That Produce Meaningless Results\n",
    "\n",
    "| Mistake | Why It's Wrong | The Consequence |\n",
    "|---------|----------------|------------------|\n",
    "| **Using unrelaxed structures** | Forces are non-zero, system is not at equilibrium | Energies, band structures, and all properties are artifacts |\n",
    "| **Insufficient k-point sampling** | Brillouin zone is not properly integrated | Total energies oscillate, wrong ground state |\n",
    "| **Too low ecutwfc** | Wavefunction is not converged | All results are basis set artifacts |\n",
    "| **Wrong magnetic configuration** | Not the true ground state | Energy differences, properties are wrong |\n",
    "| **Ignoring spin-orbit coupling** | For heavy elements, this is essential | Wrong band topology, gaps, effective masses |\n",
    "| **Using LDA/GGA for correlated systems** | Fails for Mott insulators, f-electrons | Metals predicted to be insulators (or vice versa) |\n",
    "| **Calculating properties before convergence** | Comparing unconverged quantities | Conclusions are meaningless |\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3 The Proper Scientific Mindset\n",
    "\n",
    "**Before running ANY property calculation, ask yourself:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Is my structure physically reasonable? (Compare to experiment/databases)\n",
    "2. Have I found the true ground state? (Magnetic ordering, structural phase)\n",
    "3. Are my computational parameters converged? (ecutwfc, k-points)\n",
    "4. Is my method appropriate? (LDA vs GGA vs hybrid vs DFT+U)\n",
    "5. What are the known limitations of my approach?\n",
    "\n",

    "2. **Follow the workflow** - The six-phase research workflow ensures scientifically meaningful results\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Converge before calculating properties** - ecutwfc, k-points, and structure must be converged\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Know your method's limitations** - LDA/GGA has systematic errors; use appropriate corrections\n",
